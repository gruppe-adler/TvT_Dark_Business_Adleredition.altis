This is an implementation of the **Dark Business** scenario [Awoihjaweohr created for ShackTac](http://dslyecxi.com/articles_wp/dark-business/) .

## Mission setup

There are three factions: BLUFOR, OPFOR and IND, who spawn at their respective bases in about equal numbers.
The only exception is a BLUFOR pilot who spawns without gear at the IND base (from here on referred to as "hostage")

OPFOR and IND own a small number of soft, unarmed vehicles.
BLUFOR owns an unarmed helicopter.
OPFOR owns one ammo truck.

Local time is sometime in the night. BLUFOR have fancy shit (GPS, NVG), whereas OFPOR and IND are happy to use flashlights.

## Objectives
